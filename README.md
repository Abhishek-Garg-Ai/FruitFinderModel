# FruitFinderModel

A machine learning project for classifying fruit images and retrieving related information.

## Overview

This repository contains the code and notebooks for the FruitFinderModel, a machine learning project that utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify fruit images. The model is trained on data collected via web scraping for 50+ fruit categories and achieves an accuracy of 85%. Classification results are served via a REST API.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several Jupyter notebooks, each handling a specific part of the project pipeline:

1. **1_Preparing_Data.ipynb**: 
   - Preprocessing and cleaning the collected fruit image data.

2. **2_Splitting_and_Loading_Data.ipynb**: 
   - Splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets, and loading it for model training.

3. **3_Creating_CNN_Model.ipynb**: 
   - Building and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for fruit classification.

4. **4_Evaluation_on_Images.ipynb**: 
   - Evaluating the performance of the trained model on a validation set.

5. **5_Evaluation_on_New_Images.ipynb**: 
   - Testing the model's accuracy on new, unseen images.

6. **6_Creating_Transfer_Learning_Vgg19.ipynb**: 
   - Implementing transfer learning using the VGG19 architecture to improve model performance.

7. **7_Evaluation_on_New_Images.ipynb**: 
   - Further evaluation and fine-tuning of the model on additional new images.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Web scraping for 50+ fruit categories.
- **Model Training**: CNN model with 85% classification accuracy.
- **Transfer Learning**: Incorporation of VGG19 for enhanced performance.
- **API Integration**: Serving classification results via a REST API.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Abhishek-Garg-Ai/FruitFinderModel.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd FruitFinderModel`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in order, starting with `1_Preparing_Data.ipynb`.

## Future Work

- Enhancing the dataset with more images for better accuracy.
- Improving the model with additional architectures and fine-tuning.
- Expanding the REST API to provide more detailed information about the classified fruits.
